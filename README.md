# IR Interface

Test code for monitoring several IR detectors on an Arduino UNO and displaying the results in a LabView interface.

Free to use, but I’d be keen to know if it's being used for anything interesting.
While these files are effectively unsuppoerted I’ll do my best to answer questions.
Any comments Welcome.
